# An Example of Markdown

## The simplicity  of Markdown


The Markdown syntax is a way of **structuring** documents and providing styling without having to use HTML or Cascading Style Sheets. The name is a play on the term *markup*, which is the process of preparing documents for printing through the process of editing and layout.
